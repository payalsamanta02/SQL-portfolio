### Introduction

This repository contains SQL solutions for a series of data-driven case studies. Each case study involves using advanced SQL techniques to query and analyze datasets related to diverse domains, such as education, demographics, entertainment, and restaurant management.

These case studies help refine the following SQL skills:
- Complex queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`.
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- Performance tuning for SQL queries.
- Data modeling techniques, including working with star and snowflake schemas.

### Case Studies

#### 1. Performance Analysis of Olympiad Exam

This case study focuses on evaluating the performance of students who appeared in an Olympiad exam. The dataset includes information on student scores, participation, and rankings across different regions. Key objectives include:
- Analyzing student performance by region and subject.
- Identifying top performers and trends in participation.
- Performing aggregate analysis of scores and rankings.

#### 2. Indian Census 2011

In this case study, the dataset comes from the Indian Census of 2011, providing a detailed demographic breakdown. The case study explores:
- Population distribution by state, literacy rates, and work participation.
- Calculating various census metrics and ratios.
- Querying age, gender, and population growth trends.
- Understanding the socioeconomic indicators of different regions.

#### 3. IMDB Case Study

This case study involves querying a movie dataset from IMDb to analyze:
- Movie ratings, genres, and user feedback.
- Performance of actors and directors across different years.
- Identifying trends in genres and box office performance.
- Creating complex joins between multiple tables (e.g., actors, directors, ratings, and genres).

#### 4. Danny's Diner SQL Case Study

Dannyâ€™s Diner case study involves analyzing customer behavior and restaurant sales. The key queries aim to:
- Analyze customer purchase habits and spending patterns.
- Determine the most popular items on the menu.
- Calculate total sales, profits, and customer lifetime value.
